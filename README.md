# Real-Time-Car-Counter-with-DeepSort-Yolov8

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Overview
This project implements a real-time car counter using YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking. It is designed for applications such as traffic monitoring, smart city management, and vehicle analytics.


## Features
- Real-time car detection and tracking
- High accuracy using YOLOv8 object detection model
- Efficient vehicle tracking with DeepSORT algorithm
- Works with live video streams and pre-recorded footage


## Tech Stack
- YOLOv8: State-of-the-art object detection model
- Opencv: Image processing and video handling
- Cvzone: Visualization the bounding box and label
- DeepSort: Tracking multiple vehical




## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

    
## Usage

```
    python car_counter.py
```

## Output
The program displays the live video feed with detected and tracked cars, including real-time vehicle counting.
